# METHOD: Find rank matrix, find distribution of distances to center, score is
#   the mean. The p-value can be determined by a KS test, or possibly other
#   bootstrap method. Potentially, use bootstrapping to find the difference in
#   means?

# For evaluation purposes, generate fake data, add increasing amounts of noise
#   and evaluate the methods able to still pick out the different phenotypes
