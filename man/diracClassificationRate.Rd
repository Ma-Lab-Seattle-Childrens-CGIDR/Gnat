\title{Find the classification rate for single network}
\usage{
diracClassificationRate(geneIndex, expression, phenotype1, phenotype2)
}
\arguments{
\item{expression}{Numeric matrix with gene expression data, rows are genes
columns are samples.}

\item{phenotype1, phenotype2}{Numeric vectors containing the indexes for the
two phenotypes to compare.}

\item{gene_index}{Numeric vector of index for genes in network}
}
\value{
Float representing the classification rate based on DIRAC
}
\description{
Finds the classification rate between two
phenotypes based on a gene network.
}
\details{
Classification rate is defined as the average between sensitivity and
specificity. classification_rate =
Pr(rank_diff>0|phenotype=A)*Pr(phenotype=A) +
Pr(rank_diff<=0|phenotype=B)*Pr(phenotype=B)

Due to the way that the classification rate splits 0's, this value depends
on the ordering of the gene_index vector. The order of this vector should
therefor be kept consistent.
